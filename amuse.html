	<h1>Amusement</h1>
	<h3>by Gladys Samaniego</h3>	
  <p>My sense of amusement is broad and varies depending on my current mood and interests. I’ll be recommending some options when you want to kill a good time.</p>
	
    <h2>TikToks</h2>
	<p>The Social Media that changed many lifestyles, most of the funny videos and memes are posted according to your liking and following certain algorithm which helps and you can easily scroll on your “for you” page and laugh nonstop. </p>

	<h2><em>Sometimes</em> Podcasts</h2>
	<p>Something just listening to podcast about some gossip or about inspirational topics can change your perspective about certain situation. It not only helps with personal growth, but it can also entertain you for hours.</p>
