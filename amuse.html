	<h1>Amusement</h1>
	<h3>by Gladys Samaniego</h3>	
  <p>My sense of amusement is broad and varies depending on my current mood and interests. I’ll be recommending some options when you want to kill a good time.</p>
	
    <h2>TikToks</h2>
	<p>The Social Media that changed many lifestyles, most of the funny videos and memes are posted according to your liking and following certain algorithm which helps and you can easily scroll on your “for you” page and laugh nonstop. </p>

	<h2><em>Sometimes</em> Podcasts</h2>
	<p>Something just listening to podcast about some gossip or about inspirational topics can change your perspective about certain situation and can entertain you for a minute while doing homework or just cleaning. (This tip is to my girlies mostly but men are also welcome).</p>

	<h2>Pinterest</h2>
	<p>Something that I really enjoy doing is making crafts and in this platform there are plenty of inspiration of everything, recently I have been obsess with making “eternal flowers”</p>
